BESSER Governance Engine (BGE) has been created to enforce governance policies in agentic systems, where both
human agents and AI agents interact to make decisions.
BGE rely on the governance DSL to express policies (i.e., the rules defining the decision process), and enforce them at
runtime by collecting votes and opinions of the agents on the proposed solutions and enacting the decision with respect
to the rules defined.

BGE is build on top of the BESSER Agentic Framework (BAF) and allows seamless connexion to BAF Agents, while retaining
the ability to interact with other form of agents through a websocket connexion.
